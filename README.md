## Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN
This repository contains code for hand gesture recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The code is written in Python 3 and utilizes libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and NumPy.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of hand gesture images categorized into different gestures. The dataset is structured into folders representing each gesture, with a total of 10 gestures.
## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture includes convolutional layers, max pooling layers, batch normalization, and dense layers. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and evaluates performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
## Instructions
1. **Import Libraries:** The necessary libraries for data processing, model building, and evaluation are imported.
2. **Define Gesture Labels and Prepare Dataset:** The dataset is loaded, and labels are assigned to each gesture for training the model.
3. **Visualize Random Samples from the Dataset:** Random samples from the dataset are visualized to understand the gestures and corresponding labels.
## Files
. **hand-gesture-recognition-using-cnn.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for hand gesture recognition.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook hand-gesture-recognition-using-cnn.ipynb to train and test the model.
